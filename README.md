# EzBot

This bot is a easy way to check your hypixel stats from your discord server! It also does a little replace message whenever you type ez in any channel :D

# Commands

> Things in [] are optional

!player [Game] (Player) - This will send you the stats of the specified game or the basic stats of a player. The currently supported games are:

Skywars and Bedwars

More games will be added soon.

!namehistory (Player) - This will send you all previous names of a player. 

!hypixelmeme - This will send a random hypixel meme. If you host it yourself you can add more memes.

# Install

There are two options to install. You can either host the bot yourself or you can add it to your server from my hosting.

- Hosting yourself 

    You will need a server that has Node installed. Once you've done that you will need to install discord.js and request.         Once that is done you can use the index.js file. The command "node index.js" will start the bot. I suggest searching           youtube for a tutorial on how to create a discord bot for a more detailed version of this.

- Adding the bot to your server from my hosting 

    You can add the bot to your server with this link.
